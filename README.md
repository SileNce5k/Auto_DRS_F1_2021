# Automatic DRS for F1 2021 using AutoHotKey

_Might not work if you have any saturation or something similar like image sharpening._  
Will maybe look into later if I care.

---

## If you have [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) installed

To use the script click [AutoDRS.ahk](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SileNce5k/Auto_DRS_F1_2021/master/AutoDRS.ahk), save with right click -> save page as (or just ctrl+s)  
To execute, just double click. It should appear in your system tray.  
To exit the script, you can either right click it in system tray and hit exit, or you can do "ctrl+shift+j".

## If you don't want to install AutoHotKey

Download the latest AutoDRS.exe from releases tab, place it in whatever directory you want.  
Execution is the same as above.

To set the script to start up when you login, open the run window (WindowsKey+R) and enter shell:startup.  
Put the script in this directory.
